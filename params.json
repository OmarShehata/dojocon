  "body": "## What is this?\r\n\r\nThis is a handy page of resources mentioned in our [DojoCon](http://dojocon.coderdojo.com/sessions/game-hacking-how-to-get-started/) session on teaching students to code by digging through open source games.\r\n\r\n## Resources to use \r\n\r\nThere's tons of awesome tools out there. We've found these to be especially effective at 1) being easy to setup in a 2 hour sessions and 2) engaging a broad group\r\n\r\n### The Big List of Open Source Games\r\n\r\nThis is [an awesome list](https://github.com/leereilly/games) of open source games in a variety of engines, languages and platforms. Pick one and explore it at your next Dojo! \r\n\r\nHere's [an example we did](https://medium.com/@omar4ur/hacking-super-mario-a-coderdojo-tutorial-6bbb2ae05f0c#.80969u14u) with the HTML5 Super Mario.\r\n\r\n### PlayCanvas\r\n\r\n[PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) is an awesome web-based 3D games editor. It requires no setup (beyond creating an account) and coders can jump right in. Any project on there can be forked, so it's a great source of inspiration too!\r\n\r\nHere's [an example we did](https://playcanvas.com/) for a simple Apollo 11 space ship simulator.\r\n\r\n### Mozilla Thimble \r\n\r\n[Thimble](https://playcanvas.com/) is a great tool for collaborative learning of web tools. Unlike CodePen, the project setup mirrors local development, so it bridges a knowledge gap in transitioning to bigger projects. It also highly encourages remixing. \r\n\r\n## General Tips\r\n\r\n* Try to start with a broken or an unfinished version of the game. It's a lot easier to avoid distraction and give an incentive to dive in the code.\r\n* Give the coder at least one immediate thing to try first that will yield an obvious effect. Having a place to start avoids overwhelming confusion. \r\n* Suggest ideas for further hacks of increasing difficulty. \r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nYou can find us at [@Eyeleanking](https://twitter.com/eyeleanking) and [@Omar4ur](https://twitter.com/Omar4ur)\r\n",
